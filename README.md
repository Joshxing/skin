A very recent community-based survey has shown that about 60% of the people suffer from skin disorders in India and there are about 600 million affected people throughout the world.

There are a lot of many doctors and researchers doing their best in this field of medical science, there are Machine Learning models present with very high accuracy and precision to help the researchers in this field to make their study more effective, but all these technological advancements are still quite far away from the reach of the general public. 

There are still very less or no technological resources which can add some value to the lives of people who know very little about such disorders.

To tackle this issue, we have created a web-based skin disease predictor which can be used as a native application by the users to predict their skin disorders just by uploading a picture of their skin using a machine learning model trained on the top of TensorflowJS. This app also supports real-time detection of skin diseases by which users can directly use their cameras to focus on their textured areas and get instant results. 

Further, this application also recommends nearby doctors automatically by using their current location. This app has the ability to predict over 10 skin diseases quite accurately.

# Get Started Here

You can use this link to navigate through the website- [Infinity SknCure Website](https://ishubham21.github.io/infinity-skncure) 

## Want to use the Progressive Web App?

 * Head on to the same website mentioned above on your mobile phone.
 * In the browser settings, search for the 'Add to home screen'/'Install App' option and tap it.
 * Choose your desired name for the app and tap 'done'. 
 * Web-App will be visible on your home screen.


# Features

* Can detect over 11 skin diseases accurately.
* Trained on 300,000 images.
* It's a Web-App and is installable via the browser. It also is platform-independent and can be installed on any device including but not limited to Android, iOS, Windows and macOS.
* Since the Machine Learning model is included in the package, users don't need to be present online to get their results. 
* Options to select between 'Import File' and 'Real-Time', Import file lets the users import their previously clicked images and the Real-Time feature is for Real-Time Skin Disease Detection.
* Built on the top of TensorflowJS, ml5.js and p5.js.
* Ability to show users' nearby skin doctors by taking up the users' location and performing a search.
* Interactive User Experience and an easy-to-understand User Interface makes it easier for elderlies to get the results.
* Fast, scaleable and lightweight, works on slow networks too.
* Runs on users' browsers, which means there's no use of any additional or external hardware.

## Diseases listed in the model - 
* Acne
* Herpes Zoster
* Corn
* Rosacea
* Psoriasis
* Contact Dermatitis
* Cutaneous Horn
* Eczema
* Melanoma

# Sources for dataset -

## We've used the following websites to prepare the dataset for this app

* Dermnet NZ - [https://dermnetnz.org](https://dermnetnz.org)
* DermIS - [https://dermis.net](https://dermis.net)
* Dermatology Atlas - [http://www.atlasdermatologico.com.br/browse.jsf](http://www.atlasdermatologico.com.br/browse.jsf)

# Future Scope

We're looking forward to expand the model to cover more diseases for the prediction.
